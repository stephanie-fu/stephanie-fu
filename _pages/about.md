I am an MEng student at <a href='https://csail.mit.edu/'>MIT CSAIL</a>, advised by <a href='http://web.mit.edu/phillipi/'>Professor Phillip Isola</a>. Previously, I graduated from MIT with degrees in computer science and music. During my undergrad, I had the opportunity to work on exciting research under <a href='https://billf.mit.edu/'>Professor Bill Freeman</a>, <a href='http://mit-pbg.mit.edu/'>Professor Yoel Fink</a>, and <a href='http://web.mit.edu/phillipi/'>Professor Phillip Isola</a>.

I am broadly interested in the science behind deep learning and representation learning, especially in the realm of computer vision. Most recently, I have been interested in developing and understanding models with visual intelligence.

In 2019, I co-founded <a href='https://tedx.mit.edu'>TEDxMIT</a> and helped launch the inaugural conference at MIT CSAIL. Since then, TEDxMIT has brought communities across the Greater Boston area together with three more conferences and adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic by holding a virtual event. Check out the highlight reels from past events and details about the upcoming conference <a href='https://tedx.mit.edu/'>here</a>!
